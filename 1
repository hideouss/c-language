#define: macro definition   represent numbers strings expressions  no semicolon 
source code to preprocessor to compiler    processing directives begins a # symbol
#include preprocessor  replace line with header file contents 
macro is a fragment of code is given a name       function-like macros
conditional compilation(#ifdef #if #defined #else #elseif): if statement is tested whether excute a block code when excuting 
conditional compilation used to include/skip a block code before execute       conditional codes
static variable syntax:static data_type var_name = var_value     static variable remains in memroy while prohgram is running 
normal variable or auto variable is destroyed when a function call where variable declare is over   initial static variable
standard predefined macro: name all start with double underscores   
assign operator: assign a value to a variable (= += -= *= /= %=)
data type:unsigned long  unsigned int 
pointer store variable address or memory location    unary operator &:return variable adderss      
variable address is chaging when each running  
unary operator *(asterisk):declare pointer variable  when pointer declared must has a * before its name   access value (dereference)
add 2 addresses no sense     subtract 2 addresses show the 2 addressed offset    
pointer arithmetic is meaningless only apply on an array     pointer and multi dimen array
